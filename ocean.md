Hi there! Long time no see!

Your maintainer, Botan, told me to continue Kasumi builds for Ocean, so
here you get an update!

This one might or might not include anything new specific to y'all, I
don't know, but I'll ask Botan if there's something she has changed or
not directly whenever I can.

Aside from that, this one has quite the fixes too!

Read my message for the latest release here:

Enjoy!
