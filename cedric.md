Hi Cedric users!

This update for Kasumi includes quite the fix again, nothing much in
general platform, but just some privacy and hardening patches apart
from added addons. You guys also get to use NGA as well!

Here's the message for 1.4, which is the final release of 1.x. It was
nice to have a portion of my userbase from you guys!

Enjoy it!
