Hi Cedric users!

Just another month, another ASB. This time though, I have done some
platform-specific changes instead of just a security update.

There's nothing new device-specific unfortunately. But no worries,
because even platform-specific fixes are helpful, isn't it? :P

Message for 1.3 can be found here:

Enjoy it!

P.S If you're experiencing some random crash occurring on WebView
container of Google Chrome, try switching to a more cutting edge
channel (such as Beta). I was trying to find if it's just Kasumi thing
or happens on some other ROM too. Luckily enough, my brother using an
OPPO A91 with ColorOS Android 11 also reported me that he suffers the
same issue since last week. So don't worry, even if not now, it will
hit every other Chrome user sooner or later as well.
