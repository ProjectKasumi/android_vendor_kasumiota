Hi Cedric users!

This update doesn't include anything functional for y'all sadly. But
don't fret! Because if you're an ally or a part of LGBTQIA+, I'm very
happy to celebrate pride month with you! I hope we somehow get
connected. If you want, our Discord server should now be available for
you - All you need to do is checking "Discord server" title on ROM info
dashboard. If you're still unsure about where is it, it's right in
Settings > About Phone, the part besides Kasumi glyph!

Enjoy it!
