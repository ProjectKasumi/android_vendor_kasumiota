Quite empty over here, isn't it?

Hi, I'm sorry for this sudden decision, but unfortunately, rosemary
has been temporarily dropped from 1.x.

The reason why is this happening is because, for some odd reason, my
testing builds work and boot all fine, but after regular release, not
only the regular release but also my testing release refuse to boot.
Don't get offended, I'm not blaming anyone here, but I think I need to
re-evaluate my infrastructure especially with signing part because this
wasn't supposed to happen at all.

Anyway, if you want Kasumi to be back on rosemary, you can somehow
convince Zain to publish his Android 12 trees so I can do platform
bringup with all-new infrastructure and less issues. Until then, see
you in another time and space, or perhaps with another ROM.

Goodbye! Love you all! <3
