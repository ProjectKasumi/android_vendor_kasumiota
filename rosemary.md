"Ba-Ba-Back from the dead!"

After a long time of thinking and trying hard, rosemary is back on
official roster! There has been quite a few changes ever since! Let's
take a look at what's new and what's changed, shall we?

June security patch thanks to LineageOS, with passing SafetyNet and
Play Integrity thanks to Evolution X!

Rebased on latest device trees by Woomymy!

Google Camera GO ships only on GApps builds, systematically!

Updated maintainer name to my final name: Beru Kobayashi!

Uprevisioned the ROM version to 1.4.1, to indicate some difference.
