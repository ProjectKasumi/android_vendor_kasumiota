Hey there! Long time no see!

I have no idea if your maintainer has left official maintainership at
Kasumi or not, but here you get a new update with huge
platform-specific fixes!

If you know where your maintainer is at, please hit him up to notify me
if he wants to continue or not, my Telegram username is
@Stellastructure.

If you wonder what's new from 1.3 to 1.3.1 (1.3-r2), check the commit
message here:

Cheers!
                       Beru "Stella" Hinode
